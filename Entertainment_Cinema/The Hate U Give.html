       <h4>Plot</h4>
    
               <p>Amandla Stenberg gives a masterful performance in The Hate U Giveâ€”an equally heartbreaking and eye-opening film about main character Starr (Stenberg) who's stuck navigating between two worlds: the prep school she attends that reeks of white privilege and the mostly Black neighborhood where she lives that's harmed by police brutality. It's based on Angie Thomas's 2017 novel.</p>
