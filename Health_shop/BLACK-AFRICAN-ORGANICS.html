<h3> Who Are We? </h3>
<p class="cont">Black African Organics was established in 2013 to encourage African women to embrace their natural self and feel comfortable in their own skin. The brand celebrates the true beauty of being oneself and strongly defies society’s standards of beauty. The brand believes that an individual defines their own beauty by being the best version of themselves inside and out.

We understand that it is extremely important to love one’s skin and take good care of it as it plays a major part in boosting self-confidence for most people. To help with this mission, Black African Organics was created as a comprehensive range of personal care products that are made with the best of Africa’s natural skin-loving ingredients, without the nasty chemicals.</p>
<br>
    
<p class="cont">Black African Organics offers great value that fills the gap in the beauty market for organic personal care products. Most companies that sell natural beauty products are still using some toxic ingredients that are hidden down the ingredient list. In comparison, Black African Organics products do not use any of the common toxic ingredients found in personal products so consumers can rest assured knowing that they are not putting any toxic chemicals or ingredients on their skin. In addition, our skincare products are formulated with super-ingredients such as natural plant extracts that are packed full of vitamins, nutrients and minerals. Equipped with these high standards, the brand believes that it offers incredible value to today’s consumers searching for a natural personal care product range in the market. </p>
