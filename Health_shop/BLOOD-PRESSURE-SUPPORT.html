<h3> What is High Blood Pressure? </h3>
<p class="cont">Blood pressure is affected by small smooth muscles that line the inside walls of your blood vessels.
Under normal conditions when these muscles are relaxed, your arteries operate like soft rubber tubes that expand with each beat of your heart, and your blood pressure remains normal.
When these muscles tense up, the arteries become narrower, more rigid and less flexible.
Under these conditions the heart has to beat harder to keep the blood flowing through narrowed arteries which raises pressure.
If these muscles are tense all the time, the blood pressure will remain high. This is what causes high blood pressure, which is called hypertension!
Continuous high blood pressure puts extra strain, wear and tear on your heart and arteries, that often lead to heart attacks and strokes; however, there is help in the form of blood pressure support nutritional supplements.</p>

<p class="cont">What Causes High Blood Pressure?
What are the main causes of these smooth muscles inside your arteries tensing all the time that drive your blood pressure up?
It is the loss of vital minerals from your body that are essential to the natural and effective control of blood pressure. This loss of minerals can be caused by:
	Poor diet
	Nutritional deficiencies
	Being Overweight
	Alcohol and caffeine in excess
	Emotional and physical stress
Now, a Real Solution! The RHP® Blood Pressure Support Formula
The RHP® Blood Pressure Support Formula is a dietary supplement specifically formulated for the support of healthy blood vessels, blood pressure levels and a healthy cardiovascular system. </p>
