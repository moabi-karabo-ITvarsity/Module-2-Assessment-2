  <h1 class="Junction">LAUREL SKIN </h1>
<p class="cont">Laurel Skin is committed to your health, well-being and, as a result, your beauty. Our commitment begins with the quality of the soil that nourishes and optimizes the ingredients we select. This is the foundation of mindfully sourced skincare. We then follow each ingredient from seed to harvest. Through the season it takes to grow our plants, to the months our handmade blends sit steeping, to the hours we spend bottling each batch – each step becomes a slow and intentional process. Our greatest reward is knowing you feel this thoughtfulness when you use our products.

Our commitment to your total well-being is evidenced by what is in each bottle, and what isn’t. In addition to being free of water, alcohol and fillers, Laurel Skin rejects any of the harmful or questionable ingredients often found in skincare – carcinogens, hormone disruptors, synthetic fragrances, lab-derived and bio-identical ingredients, GMOs, and even conventionally grown plants. It is our belief that these ingredients can possibly do long-term damage to the skin, the body and the planet.

<p class="cont">It is a common misconception that synthetic, lab-created ingredients are necessary to achieve positive results in skin care. This is not true. Lab-made ingredients are cheaper than real plants and they cannot contain the nutrient content and vibrancy that Nature can deliver. By contrast, our 100% organic, raw, unrefined whole plant ingredients contain hundreds of antioxidants, vitamins, and nutrients. In short, there is simply no man-made ingredient that can compare to the delicate, intricate, and powerful science of nature.

Laurel Skin was created with spas and estheticians in mind. Offering the complexity to support customized, results-driven facials, yet intuitive enough for home use, the line invites a slow farmed beauty ritual at home or at the spa. We believe that our mindful beauty rituals can take years off the mind, body, and spirit, not only the skin.</p>
