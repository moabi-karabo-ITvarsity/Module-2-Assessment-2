<h2 class="us">Who are we?</h2>
<a class="about">Gerakaris Wines was founded in 2009 by Pine City Municipality. Our boutique winery in the heart of Craighall Park, Jozi, produces wines from grapes sourced from a single farm in the Swartland, Western Cape.

Five wines are made by winemaker Kath Gerakaris. Two Chenin blancs and three Syrahs.<br/><br/>

Wine tastings are R100 person. We also serve a cheese board designed to match our wines, show casing four South African cheese producers, and bowls of Cape Olives. We have a small garden and we like it this way because we can chat to everyone about what we do… however it does mean weekends get busy and you need to make a booking ahead of time.
