  <p>The first Foot Locker store opened in Gauteng in 1986 in an industrial warehouse of 500m2 - and was an instant success. By the year 2000, there were 65 stores with no sign of this growth being stifled.</p>
<p>In 2005, Foot Locke became part of a much bigger family - the Pepkor Group - which allowed us to grow even more, making affordable, stylish footwear available to a larger market. By 2007, 95 stores had opened nationwide. As shopping malls become more accessible destinations, Foot Locke shook off itâ€™s industrial roots, and we revamped our look. Today, our customers can trust us for style and affordability, as we offer a unique store experience that caters to both those who need assistance or just want to browse on their own.</p>
